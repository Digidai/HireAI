## Evaluation Guide

This section is a structured checklist based on the directory tags and era. It does not assume features—use it to verify capabilities with demos, docs, and a pilot.

### Baseline Checklist

- Define primary use cases and who will use the product day-to-day.
- Validate end-to-end workflow fit (data in → decisions/actions → reporting).
- Confirm integrations (ATS/HRIS, calendar, email, SSO) and data sync details.
- Review permissions, audit logs, and governance for hiring-sensitive actions.
- Measure impact with a pilot and agreed success metrics (speed, quality, experience).

### Era Context

- Expect agentic priorities: safe autonomy, human-in-the-loop controls, and strong auditability.
- Use the tag checklists below to validate product-specific requirements for your stack.

### Tag Checklists

#### Conversational AI

- Validate NLU accuracy for your domain terms and edge-case queries.
- Confirm multi-turn context handling and safe escalation to human support.
- Review conversation logs, retention, and access controls for sensitive data.
- Test candidate experience across channels and devices.

#### Interview Intelligence

- Check capture methods (Zoom/Meet/Teams) and consent/recording policies.
- Validate summary quality, action items, and linkage to scorecards/competencies.
- Confirm data access controls for interview recordings and transcripts.
- Review coaching and calibration workflows to improve interviewer consistency.

#### Bias Reduction

- Ask what fairness metrics are measured and how often monitoring runs.
- Verify that bias controls don’t reduce job relevance or create new adverse impact.
- Confirm transparency for stakeholders and documentation for compliance audits.
- Pilot with segmented analysis by role, location, and demographic proxies where legal.

#### DEI

- Confirm the product supports inclusive workflows without masking critical job signals.
- Review reporting and monitoring options for representation and stage outcomes.
- Check policy controls (structured rubrics, required justifications) to reduce bias.
- Ensure compliance alignment for relevant jurisdictions and internal policy.
