### Baseline Checklist

- Define primary use cases and who will use the product day-to-day.
- Validate end-to-end workflow fit (data in → decisions/actions → reporting).
- Confirm integrations (ATS/HRIS, calendar, email, SSO) and data sync details.
- Review permissions, audit logs, and governance for hiring-sensitive actions.
- Measure impact with a pilot and agreed success metrics (speed, quality, experience).

### Era Context

- Expect intelligence priorities: skills, analytics, fairness monitoring, and decision support.
- Use the tag checklists below to validate product-specific requirements for your stack.

### Tag Checklists

#### Job Board

- Verify posting coverage, distribution partners, and source attribution accuracy.
- Check budget controls, sponsorship options, and performance reporting.
- Confirm compliance and content rules for different regions and role types.
- Ensure clean handoff to application/ATS with dedupe and tracking.

#### Sourcing

- Validate search filters, enrichment accuracy, and deduplication with ATS/CRM.
- Check outreach workflow integration and collaboration across recruiters.
- Confirm data provenance, acceptable use, and regional compliance.
