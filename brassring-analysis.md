## Evaluation Guide

This section is a structured checklist based on the directory tags and era. It does not assume features—use it to verify capabilities with demos, docs, and a pilot.

### Baseline Checklist

- Define primary use cases and who will use the product day-to-day.
- Validate end-to-end workflow fit (data in → decisions/actions → reporting).
- Confirm integrations (ATS/HRIS, calendar, email, SSO) and data sync details.
- Review permissions, audit logs, and governance for hiring-sensitive actions.
- Measure impact with a pilot and agreed success metrics (speed, quality, experience).

### Era Context

- Expect core-system priorities: reliability, compliance, data model flexibility, and integrations.
- Use the tag checklists below to validate product-specific requirements for your stack.

### Tag Checklists

#### ATS

- Validate requisition creation, approval flows, and pipeline stage customization.
- Check scheduling, offer management, compliance reporting, and role-based access.
- Verify integrations with HRIS/HCM, background checks, e-sign, and calendars.
- Assess reporting, data exports, and migration tooling from your current ATS.

#### Enterprise

- Validate SSO/SAML, SCIM provisioning, RBAC, and audit logging requirements.
- Confirm global compliance needs (GDPR, SOC reports) and contract terms.
- Check scalability (multi-entity, multi-region) and admin delegation.
- Review implementation support, SLAs, and change management processes.

#### Workflow

- Map end-to-end processes and confirm configurability without heavy engineering.
- Validate permissions, approvals, and audit logs for critical transitions.
- Check integrations and handoffs between stages and teams.
- Ensure reporting aligns to workflow stages and changes are versioned.
