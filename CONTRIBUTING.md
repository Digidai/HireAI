# How to Contribute

We welcome contributions to this project! If you have an HR AI product you'd like to add, please follow these steps.

## Adding a New Product Analysis

1.  **Fork the repository:** Start by forking the project to your own GitHub account.
2.  **Create a new analysis file:** In the root directory, create a new markdown file for your analysis. The filename should be in the format `product-name-analysis.md`.
3.  **Use the template:** Copy the content of `_templates/analysis_template.md` into your new file. This will give you the correct structure for the analysis.
4.  **Fill out the analysis:** Complete the analysis to the best of your ability. Be objective and provide concrete examples where possible.
5.  **Update the data file:** Open the `_data/products.yml` file and add an entry for your new product. Make sure to include the `name`, `url`, `analysis` (linking to your new file), `description`, and `tags`.
6.  **Create a pull request:** Once you're happy with your analysis, create a pull request to merge your changes into the main repository.
