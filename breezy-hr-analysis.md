## Evaluation Guide

This section is a structured checklist based on the directory tags and era. It does not assume features—use it to verify capabilities with demos, docs, and a pilot.

### Baseline Checklist

- Define primary use cases and who will use the product day-to-day.
- Validate end-to-end workflow fit (data in → decisions/actions → reporting).
- Confirm integrations (ATS/HRIS, calendar, email, SSO) and data sync details.
- Review permissions, audit logs, and governance for hiring-sensitive actions.
- Measure impact with a pilot and agreed success metrics (speed, quality, experience).

### Era Context

- Expect intelligence priorities: skills, analytics, fairness monitoring, and decision support.
- Use the tag checklists below to validate product-specific requirements for your stack.

### Tag Checklists

#### ATS

#### Workflow

- Map end-to-end processes and confirm configurability without heavy engineering.
