## Evaluation Guide

This section is a structured checklist based on the directory tags and era. It does not assume features—use it to verify capabilities with demos, docs, and a pilot.

### Baseline Checklist

- Define primary use cases and who will use the product day-to-day.
- Validate end-to-end workflow fit (data in → decisions/actions → reporting).
- Confirm integrations (ATS/HRIS, calendar, email, SSO) and data sync details.
- Review permissions, audit logs, and governance for hiring-sensitive actions.
- Measure impact with a pilot and agreed success metrics (speed, quality, experience).

### Era Context

- Expect intelligence priorities: skills, analytics, fairness monitoring, and decision support.
- Use the tag checklists below to validate product-specific requirements for your stack.

### Tag Checklists

#### CRM

- Check talent pool segmentation, tagging, and deduplication across sources.
- Validate nurture campaigns, sequences, and deliverability controls.
- Confirm consent management and unsubscribe handling by region.
- Ensure CRM data stays synced with ATS stages and recruiter ownership.

#### Candidate Engagement

- Validate outreach channels (email, SMS, chat) and response tracking.
- Check personalization controls, templates, and compliance with consent rules.
- Measure response rates and drop-off by stage with A/B test support if available.

#### Enterprise

- Confirm global compliance needs (GDPR, SOC reports) and contract terms.
- Check scalability (multi-entity, multi-region) and admin delegation.
- Review implementation support, SLAs, and change management processes.
