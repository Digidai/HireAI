## Evaluation Guide

This section is a structured checklist based on the directory tags and era. It does not assume features—use it to verify capabilities with demos, docs, and a pilot.

### Baseline Checklist

- Define primary use cases and who will use the product day-to-day.
- Validate end-to-end workflow fit (data in → decisions/actions → reporting).
- Confirm integrations (ATS/HRIS, calendar, email, SSO) and data sync details.
- Review permissions, audit logs, and governance for hiring-sensitive actions.
- Measure impact with a pilot and agreed success metrics (speed, quality, experience).

### Era Context

- Expect agentic priorities: safe autonomy, human-in-the-loop controls, and strong auditability.
- Use the tag checklists below to validate product-specific requirements for your stack.

### Tag Checklists

#### ATS

- Validate requisition creation, approval flows, and pipeline stage customization.
- Check scheduling, offer management, compliance reporting, and role-based access.
- Verify integrations with HRIS/HCM, background checks, e-sign, and calendars.
- Assess reporting, data exports, and migration tooling from your current ATS.

#### HCM

- Validate integration with your HRIS/HCM (identity, org chart, job catalog).
- Confirm data sync cadence, field mappings, and error handling.
- Check role-based access for sensitive employee data.
- Ensure reporting aligns across recruiting and core HR data.

#### AI

- Separate AI-assisted suggestions from deterministic rules and document both paths.
- Ask what data is used to produce outputs and whether your data is used for training.
- Validate output quality on your own historical datasets with agreed success metrics.
- Review bias, explainability, and compliance controls appropriate for hiring decisions.
- Confirm admin controls for prompts, templates, and model behavior updates.

#### SMB

- Confirm pricing fit, onboarding effort, and admin simplicity for small teams.
- Validate core integrations (email, calendar, ATS/HRIS) without heavy IT work.
- Check support availability and self-serve documentation quality.
- Ensure workflows scale as hiring volume grows.
