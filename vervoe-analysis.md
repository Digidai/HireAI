## Evaluation Guide

This section is a structured checklist based on the directory tags and era. It does not assume features—use it to verify capabilities with demos, docs, and a pilot.

### Baseline Checklist

- Define primary use cases and who will use the product day-to-day.
- Validate end-to-end workflow fit (data in → decisions/actions → reporting).
- Confirm integrations (ATS/HRIS, calendar, email, SSO) and data sync details.
- Review permissions, audit logs, and governance for hiring-sensitive actions.
- Measure impact with a pilot and agreed success metrics (speed, quality, experience).

### Era Context

- Expect agentic priorities: safe autonomy, human-in-the-loop controls, and strong auditability.
- Use the tag checklists below to validate product-specific requirements for your stack.

### Tag Checklists

#### Assessment

- Verify assessment validity, reliability, and job relevance for your roles.
- Check proctoring options, anti-cheating measures, and accommodation support.
- Confirm score interpretation, cutoffs, and how results flow into hiring workflows.
- Review adverse impact monitoring and candidate communication requirements.

#### Skills-based Hiring

- Confirm skill taxonomy/ontology and how skills are inferred and validated.
- Check mapping from skills to roles, leveling, and learning resources.
- Validate bias impact and transparency of skill scoring.
- Ensure skills data integrates into ATS/HRIS and reporting.

#### AI

- Separate AI-assisted suggestions from deterministic rules and document both paths.
- Ask what data is used to produce outputs and whether your data is used for training.
- Validate output quality on your own historical datasets with agreed success metrics.
- Review bias, explainability, and compliance controls appropriate for hiring decisions.
- Confirm admin controls for prompts, templates, and model behavior updates.

#### Evaluation

- Define evaluation criteria and weightings before vendor demos.
- Require an end-to-end pilot with real roles, real data, and clear success metrics.
- Compare total cost of ownership including implementation and integration work.
- Capture stakeholder feedback systematically to avoid recency bias.
