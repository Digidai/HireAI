### Baseline Checklist

- Validate end-to-end workflow fit (data in → decisions/actions → reporting).
- Confirm integrations (ATS/HRIS, calendar, email, SSO) and data sync details.
- Review permissions, audit logs, and governance for hiring-sensitive actions.
- Measure impact with a pilot and agreed success metrics (speed, quality, experience).

### Era Context

- Expect workflow priorities: collaboration, integrations, and operational automation across recruiting teams.
- Use the tag checklists below to validate product-specific requirements for your stack.

### Tag Checklists

#### ATS

#### Marketplace
