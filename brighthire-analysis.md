## Evaluation Guide

This section is a structured checklist based on the directory tags and era. It does not assume features—use it to verify capabilities with demos, docs, and a pilot.

### Baseline Checklist

- Define primary use cases and who will use the product day-to-day.
- Validate end-to-end workflow fit (data in → decisions/actions → reporting).
- Confirm integrations (ATS/HRIS, calendar, email, SSO) and data sync details.
- Review permissions, audit logs, and governance for hiring-sensitive actions.
- Measure impact with a pilot and agreed success metrics (speed, quality, experience).

### Era Context

- Expect agentic priorities: safe autonomy, human-in-the-loop controls, and strong auditability.
- Use the tag checklists below to validate product-specific requirements for your stack.

### Tag Checklists

#### Interview Intelligence

- Check capture methods (Zoom/Meet/Teams) and consent/recording policies.
- Validate summary quality, action items, and linkage to scorecards/competencies.
- Confirm data access controls for interview recordings and transcripts.
- Review coaching and calibration workflows to improve interviewer consistency.

#### AI

- Separate AI-assisted suggestions from deterministic rules and document both paths.
- Ask what data is used to produce outputs and whether your data is used for training.
- Validate output quality on your own historical datasets with agreed success metrics.
- Review bias, explainability, and compliance controls appropriate for hiring decisions.
- Confirm admin controls for prompts, templates, and model behavior updates.

#### Structured Interviewing

- Confirm rubric/scorecard support and consistent question sets per role.
- Validate interviewer training, calibration, and anti-bias guardrails.
- Check feedback collection, reminders, and completion SLAs.
- Ensure audit trails for decisions and versioning for rubrics over time.
