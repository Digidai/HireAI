## Evaluation Guide

This section is a structured checklist based on the directory tags and era. It does not assume features—use it to verify capabilities with demos, docs, and a pilot.

### Baseline Checklist

- Define primary use cases and who will use the product day-to-day.
- Validate end-to-end workflow fit (data in → decisions/actions → reporting).
- Confirm integrations (ATS/HRIS, calendar, email, SSO) and data sync details.
- Review permissions, audit logs, and governance for hiring-sensitive actions.
- Measure impact with a pilot and agreed success metrics (speed, quality, experience).

### Era Context

- Expect agentic priorities: safe autonomy, human-in-the-loop controls, and strong auditability.
- Use the tag checklists below to validate product-specific requirements for your stack.

### Tag Checklists

#### AI

- Separate AI-assisted suggestions from deterministic rules and document both paths.
- Ask what data is used to produce outputs and whether your data is used for training.
- Validate output quality on your own historical datasets with agreed success metrics.
- Review bias, explainability, and compliance controls appropriate for hiring decisions.
- Confirm admin controls for prompts, templates, and model behavior updates.

#### Technical Assessment

- Validate question quality, role relevance, and support for multiple languages.
- Check anti-cheating, plagiarism detection, and environment controls.
- Confirm scoring transparency and integration into ATS workflows.
- Pilot with real engineers and compare to on-the-job performance signals.

#### Sourcing

- Validate search filters, enrichment accuracy, and deduplication with ATS/CRM.
- Check outreach workflow integration and collaboration across recruiters.
- Confirm data provenance, acceptable use, and regional compliance.
- Measure quality of pipeline and conversion to interview/offer.

#### Remote

- Validate support for distributed interviewing and time zone scheduling.
- Check identity verification, fraud controls, and remote proctoring if relevant.
- Confirm communication workflows for candidates across regions.
- Review compliance for recording/transcripts in different jurisdictions.

#### Developer Community

- Verify how community signals map to candidate quality (skills, projects, activity).
- Check sourcing permissions and acceptable-use policies for outreach.
- Confirm data freshness and identity resolution to avoid duplicates.
- Validate conversion funnels from community to applicant/interview.
