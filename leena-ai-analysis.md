## Evaluation Guide

This section is a structured checklist based on the directory tags and era. It does not assume features—use it to verify capabilities with demos, docs, and a pilot.

### Baseline Checklist

- Define primary use cases and who will use the product day-to-day.
- Validate end-to-end workflow fit (data in → decisions/actions → reporting).
- Confirm integrations (ATS/HRIS, calendar, email, SSO) and data sync details.
- Review permissions, audit logs, and governance for hiring-sensitive actions.
- Measure impact with a pilot and agreed success metrics (speed, quality, experience).

### Era Context

- Expect agentic priorities: safe autonomy, human-in-the-loop controls, and strong auditability.
- Use the tag checklists below to validate product-specific requirements for your stack.

### Tag Checklists

#### Conversational AI

- Validate NLU accuracy for your domain terms and edge-case queries.
- Confirm multi-turn context handling and safe escalation to human support.
- Review conversation logs, retention, and access controls for sensitive data.
- Test candidate experience across channels and devices.

#### AI Assistant

- Clarify whether it drafts content, provides recommendations, or executes workflow steps.
- Check how context is gathered (ATS records, emails, notes) and how it is filtered.
- Verify redaction controls for sensitive data and safe-sharing to external channels.
- Measure time saved with a small pilot and define guardrails before broad rollout.

#### Automation

- Map triggers, actions, and exceptions for each automation and document owners.
- Confirm throttling, approvals, and guardrails for candidate-facing actions.
- Verify audit trails and easy disable/rollback for problematic workflows.
- Test edge cases (duplicates, reschedules, rejected candidates) end-to-end.

#### Enterprise

- Validate SSO/SAML, SCIM provisioning, RBAC, and audit logging requirements.
- Confirm global compliance needs (GDPR, SOC reports) and contract terms.
- Check scalability (multi-entity, multi-region) and admin delegation.
- Review implementation support, SLAs, and change management processes.
