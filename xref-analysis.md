## Evaluation Guide

This section is a structured checklist based on the directory tags and era. It does not assume features—use it to verify capabilities with demos, docs, and a pilot.

### Baseline Checklist

- Define primary use cases and who will use the product day-to-day.
- Validate end-to-end workflow fit (data in → decisions/actions → reporting).
- Confirm integrations (ATS/HRIS, calendar, email, SSO) and data sync details.
- Review permissions, audit logs, and governance for hiring-sensitive actions.
- Measure impact with a pilot and agreed success metrics (speed, quality, experience).

### Era Context

- Expect agentic priorities: safe autonomy, human-in-the-loop controls, and strong auditability.
- Use the tag checklists below to validate product-specific requirements for your stack.

### Tag Checklists

#### Reference Checking

- Confirm how references are collected, verified, and protected from fraud.
- Check questionnaire configurability and reporting summaries.
- Verify compliance and candidate consent flows for each region.
- Ensure results integrate cleanly into ATS and decision documentation.

#### AI

- Separate AI-assisted suggestions from deterministic rules and document both paths.
- Ask what data is used to produce outputs and whether your data is used for training.
- Validate output quality on your own historical datasets with agreed success metrics.
- Review bias, explainability, and compliance controls appropriate for hiring decisions.
- Confirm admin controls for prompts, templates, and model behavior updates.

#### Automation

- Map triggers, actions, and exceptions for each automation and document owners.
- Confirm throttling, approvals, and guardrails for candidate-facing actions.
- Verify audit trails and easy disable/rollback for problematic workflows.
- Test edge cases (duplicates, reschedules, rejected candidates) end-to-end.
