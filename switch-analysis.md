### Baseline Checklist

- Define primary use cases and who will use the product day-to-day.
- Validate end-to-end workflow fit (data in → decisions/actions → reporting).
- Confirm integrations (ATS/HRIS, calendar, email, SSO) and data sync details.
- Review permissions, audit logs, and governance for hiring-sensitive actions.
- Measure impact with a pilot and agreed success metrics (speed, quality, experience).

### Era Context

- Expect workflow priorities: collaboration, integrations, and operational automation across recruiting teams.
- Use the tag checklists below to validate product-specific requirements for your stack.

### Tag Checklists

#### High-Volume

- Confirm throughput for scheduling, screening, and messaging at scale.

- Check queue management, bulk actions, and operational dashboards.
- Measure speed-to-contact and stage conversion improvements in a pilot.

#### Candidate Engagement

- Validate outreach channels (email, SMS, chat) and response tracking.
- Check personalization controls, templates, and compliance with consent rules.
