- Review permissions, audit logs, and governance for hiring-sensitive actions.
- Measure impact with a pilot and agreed success metrics (speed, quality, experience).

### Era Context

- Use the tag checklists below to validate product-specific requirements for your stack.

### Tag Checklists

#### Technical Assessment

- Validate question quality, role relevance, and support for multiple languages.
