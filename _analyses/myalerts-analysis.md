## Evaluation Guide

This section is a structured checklist based on the directory tags and era. It does not assume features—use it to verify capabilities with demos, docs, and a pilot.

### Baseline Checklist

- Define primary use cases and who will use the product day-to-day.
- Validate end-to-end workflow fit (data in → decisions/actions → reporting).
- Confirm integrations (ATS/HRIS, calendar, email, SSO) and data sync details.
- Review permissions, audit logs, and governance for hiring-sensitive actions.
- Measure impact with a pilot and agreed success metrics (speed, quality, experience).

### Era Context

- Expect core-system priorities: reliability, compliance, data model flexibility, and integrations.
- Use the tag checklists below to validate product-specific requirements for your stack.

### Tag Checklists

#### Candidate Engagement

- Validate outreach channels (email, SMS, chat) and response tracking.
- Check personalization controls, templates, and compliance with consent rules.
- Measure response rates and drop-off by stage with A/B test support if available.
- Ensure handoff to recruiters is clear with SLA and ownership.

#### Automation

- Map triggers, actions, and exceptions for each automation and document owners.
- Confirm throttling, approvals, and guardrails for candidate-facing actions.
- Verify audit trails and easy disable/rollback for problematic workflows.
- Test edge cases (duplicates, reschedules, rejected candidates) end-to-end.
