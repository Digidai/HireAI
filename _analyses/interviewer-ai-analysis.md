## Evaluation Guide

This section is a structured checklist based on the directory tags and era. It does not assume features—use it to verify capabilities with demos, docs, and a pilot.

### Baseline Checklist

- Define primary use cases and who will use the product day-to-day.
- Validate end-to-end workflow fit (data in → decisions/actions → reporting).
- Confirm integrations (ATS/HRIS, calendar, email, SSO) and data sync details.
- Review permissions, audit logs, and governance for hiring-sensitive actions.
- Measure impact with a pilot and agreed success metrics (speed, quality, experience).

### Era Context

- Expect agentic priorities: safe autonomy, human-in-the-loop controls, and strong auditability.
- Use the tag checklists below to validate product-specific requirements for your stack.

### Tag Checklists

#### Video Interviewing

- Confirm live vs one-way support, scheduling, and time zone handling.
- Review consent, recording policies, and retention for video assets.
- Validate accessibility (captions) and accommodation workflows.
- Ensure structured evaluation and guardrails for automated analysis if used.

#### AI

- Separate AI-assisted suggestions from deterministic rules and document both paths.
- Ask what data is used to produce outputs and whether your data is used for training.
- Validate output quality on your own historical datasets with agreed success metrics.
- Review bias, explainability, and compliance controls appropriate for hiring decisions.
- Confirm admin controls for prompts, templates, and model behavior updates.

#### Screening

- Validate screening questions, knockout logic, and exception handling.
- Confirm auditability for why candidates advance or are rejected.
- Check accommodation workflows and candidate appeal processes where needed.
- Ensure smooth handoff into interview scheduling and ATS stages.

#### High-Volume

- Confirm throughput for scheduling, screening, and messaging at scale.
- Validate automation guardrails to prevent spamming and inconsistent decisions.
- Check queue management, bulk actions, and operational dashboards.
- Measure speed-to-contact and stage conversion improvements in a pilot.
