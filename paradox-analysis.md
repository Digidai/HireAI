## Evaluation Guide

This section is a structured checklist based on the directory tags and era. It does not assume features—use it to verify capabilities with demos, docs, and a pilot.

### Baseline Checklist

- Define primary use cases and who will use the product day-to-day.
- Validate end-to-end workflow fit (data in → decisions/actions → reporting).
- Confirm integrations (ATS/HRIS, calendar, email, SSO) and data sync details.
- Review permissions, audit logs, and governance for hiring-sensitive actions.
- Measure impact with a pilot and agreed success metrics (speed, quality, experience).

### Era Context

- Expect agentic priorities: safe autonomy, human-in-the-loop controls, and strong auditability.
- Use the tag checklists below to validate product-specific requirements for your stack.

### Tag Checklists

#### Conversational AI

- Validate NLU accuracy for your domain terms and edge-case queries.
- Confirm multi-turn context handling and safe escalation to human support.
- Review conversation logs, retention, and access controls for sensitive data.
- Test candidate experience across channels and devices.

#### Chatbot

- Confirm supported channels and the handoff path to a human recruiter.
- Verify intent coverage for your FAQs and how new intents are trained/added.
- Check logging, PII handling, and consent notices in candidate conversations.
- Test multi-language, accessibility, and failure handling for edge cases.

#### AI

- Separate AI-assisted suggestions from deterministic rules and document both paths.
- Ask what data is used to produce outputs and whether your data is used for training.
- Validate output quality on your own historical datasets with agreed success metrics.
- Review bias, explainability, and compliance controls appropriate for hiring decisions.
- Confirm admin controls for prompts, templates, and model behavior updates.
