### Baseline Checklist

- Define primary use cases and who will use the product day-to-day.
- Validate end-to-end workflow fit (data in → decisions/actions → reporting).
- Confirm integrations (ATS/HRIS, calendar, email, SSO) and data sync details.
- Review permissions, audit logs, and governance for hiring-sensitive actions.
- Measure impact with a pilot and agreed success metrics (speed, quality, experience).

### Era Context

- Expect intelligence priorities: skills, analytics, fairness monitoring, and decision support.
- Use the tag checklists below to validate product-specific requirements for your stack.

### Tag Checklists

#### ATS

- Validate requisition creation, approval flows, and pipeline stage customization.
- Check scheduling, offer management, compliance reporting, and role-based access.
- Verify integrations with HRIS/HCM, background checks, e-sign, and calendars.
- Assess reporting, data exports, and migration tooling from your current ATS.

#### CRM

- Check talent pool segmentation, tagging, and deduplication across sources.
- Validate nurture campaigns, sequences, and deliverability controls.
- Confirm consent management and unsubscribe handling by region.
