## Evaluation Guide

This section is a structured checklist based on the directory tags and era. It does not assume features—use it to verify capabilities with demos, docs, and a pilot.

### Baseline Checklist

- Define primary use cases and who will use the product day-to-day.
- Validate end-to-end workflow fit (data in → decisions/actions → reporting).
- Confirm integrations (ATS/HRIS, calendar, email, SSO) and data sync details.
- Review permissions, audit logs, and governance for hiring-sensitive actions.
- Measure impact with a pilot and agreed success metrics (speed, quality, experience).

### Era Context

- Expect workflow priorities: collaboration, integrations, and operational automation across recruiting teams.
- Use the tag checklists below to validate product-specific requirements for your stack.

### Tag Checklists

#### Technical Assessment

- Validate question quality, role relevance, and support for multiple languages.
- Check anti-cheating, plagiarism detection, and environment controls.
- Confirm scoring transparency and integration into ATS workflows.
- Pilot with real engineers and compare to on-the-job performance signals.

#### Skills-based Hiring

- Confirm skill taxonomy/ontology and how skills are inferred and validated.
- Check mapping from skills to roles, leveling, and learning resources.
- Validate bias impact and transparency of skill scoring.
- Ensure skills data integrates into ATS/HRIS and reporting.
