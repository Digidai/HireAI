## Evaluation Guide

This section is a structured checklist based on the directory tags and era. It does not assume features—use it to verify capabilities with demos, docs, and a pilot.

### Baseline Checklist

- Define primary use cases and who will use the product day-to-day.
- Validate end-to-end workflow fit (data in → decisions/actions → reporting).
- Confirm integrations (ATS/HRIS, calendar, email, SSO) and data sync details.
- Review permissions, audit logs, and governance for hiring-sensitive actions.
- Measure impact with a pilot and agreed success metrics (speed, quality, experience).

### Era Context

- Expect agentic priorities: safe autonomy, human-in-the-loop controls, and strong auditability.
- Use the tag checklists below to validate product-specific requirements for your stack.

### Tag Checklists

#### Video Interviewing

- Confirm live vs one-way support, scheduling, and time zone handling.
- Review consent, recording policies, and retention for video assets.
- Validate accessibility (captions) and accommodation workflows.
- Ensure structured evaluation and guardrails for automated analysis if used.

#### AI

- Separate AI-assisted suggestions from deterministic rules and document both paths.
- Ask what data is used to produce outputs and whether your data is used for training.
- Validate output quality on your own historical datasets with agreed success metrics.
- Review bias, explainability, and compliance controls appropriate for hiring decisions.
- Confirm admin controls for prompts, templates, and model behavior updates.

#### Remote

- Validate support for distributed interviewing and time zone scheduling.
- Check identity verification, fraud controls, and remote proctoring if relevant.
- Confirm communication workflows for candidates across regions.
- Review compliance for recording/transcripts in different jurisdictions.

#### Collaboration

- Verify stakeholder workflows (approvals, comments, scorecards) across teams.
- Confirm permissions, audit logs, and notification controls.
- Check integration with Slack/Teams/email and how information is shared securely.
- Evaluate reporting across multiple reviewers and calibration workflows.
