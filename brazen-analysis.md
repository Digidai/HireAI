## Evaluation Guide

This section is a structured checklist based on the directory tags and era. It does not assume features—use it to verify capabilities with demos, docs, and a pilot.

### Baseline Checklist

- Define primary use cases and who will use the product day-to-day.
- Validate end-to-end workflow fit (data in → decisions/actions → reporting).
- Confirm integrations (ATS/HRIS, calendar, email, SSO) and data sync details.
- Review permissions, audit logs, and governance for hiring-sensitive actions.
- Measure impact with a pilot and agreed success metrics (speed, quality, experience).

### Era Context

- Expect agentic priorities: safe autonomy, human-in-the-loop controls, and strong auditability.
- Use the tag checklists below to validate product-specific requirements for your stack.

### Tag Checklists

#### Chatbot

- Confirm supported channels and the handoff path to a human recruiter.
- Verify intent coverage for your FAQs and how new intents are trained/added.
- Check logging, PII handling, and consent notices in candidate conversations.
- Test multi-language, accessibility, and failure handling for edge cases.

#### Candidate Engagement

- Validate outreach channels (email, SMS, chat) and response tracking.
- Check personalization controls, templates, and compliance with consent rules.
- Measure response rates and drop-off by stage with A/B test support if available.
- Ensure handoff to recruiters is clear with SLA and ownership.

#### AI

- Separate AI-assisted suggestions from deterministic rules and document both paths.
- Ask what data is used to produce outputs and whether your data is used for training.
- Validate output quality on your own historical datasets with agreed success metrics.
- Review bias, explainability, and compliance controls appropriate for hiring decisions.
- Confirm admin controls for prompts, templates, and model behavior updates.
