## About DEI in HR Technology

Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) technology helps organizations build more representative workforces by identifying and mitigating bias throughout the hiring process.

### DEI Technology Applications

| Application | How It Helps |
|-------------|--------------|
| **Bias Detection** | Identifies biased language in job descriptions |
| **Blind Screening** | Removes identifying information from applications |
| **Diverse Sourcing** | Expands candidate pools to underrepresented groups |
| **Analytics** | Tracks diversity metrics across the funnel |
| **Interview Guides** | Structured questions reduce subjective bias |

### Implementation Considerations

- DEI tools work best as part of a broader inclusion strategy
- Measure outcomes, not just tool adoption
- Ensure compliance with local employment laws
- Balance automation with human judgment
- Regularly audit for unintended consequences
