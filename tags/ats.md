## About Applicant Tracking Systems

An Applicant Tracking System (ATS) is the core infrastructure of modern recruiting operations. It manages job postings, applications, candidate pipelines, and hiring workflows from requisition to offer.

### ATS Evolution

| Generation | Era | Characteristics |
|------------|-----|-----------------|
| **1.0** | 1990s | Database-centric, compliance-focused |
| **2.0** | 2000s | Web-based, workflow automation |
| **3.0** | 2010s | Cloud-native, candidate experience |
| **4.0** | 2020s | AI-powered, integrated talent suite |

### Choosing an ATS

Consider these factors:
- **Company Size**: Enterprise vs. SMB requirements differ significantly

- **Integration**: Connect with HRIS, assessments, background checks
- **User Experience**: Recruiter and candidate satisfaction matters
- **Reporting**: Analytics and compliance reporting capabilities
