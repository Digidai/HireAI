## About Agentic AI in HR

Agentic AI represents the latest evolution in HR technology. Unlike traditional AI that provides recommendations, agentic systems can autonomously execute complex workflows—scheduling interviews, sending personalized outreach, and even making preliminary screening decisions.

### Agentic vs. Traditional AI

| Aspect | Traditional AI | Agentic AI |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| **Role** | Advisor/Recommender | Autonomous Actor |
| **Actions** | Suggests next steps | Executes workflows |
| **Oversight** | Human makes decisions | Human sets guardrails |
| **Complexity** | Single-task focused | Multi-step orchestration |

### Key Considerations

- **Governance**: Define clear boundaries for autonomous actions
- **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive logging for compliance
- **Fallback**: Human escalation paths when AI is uncertain
- **Testing**: Extensive validation before production deployment

### Leading Agentic AI Vendors

The 2024+ era is defined by platforms that combine AI intelligence with autonomous execution capabilities.
