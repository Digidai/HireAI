## Evaluation Guide

This section is a structured checklist based on the directory tags and era. It does not assume features—use it to verify capabilities with demos, docs, and a pilot.

### Baseline Checklist

- Define primary use cases and who will use the product day-to-day.
- Validate end-to-end workflow fit (data in → decisions/actions → reporting).
- Confirm integrations (ATS/HRIS, calendar, email, SSO) and data sync details.
- Review permissions, audit logs, and governance for hiring-sensitive actions.
- Measure impact with a pilot and agreed success metrics (speed, quality, experience).

### Era Context

- Expect agentic priorities: safe autonomy, human-in-the-loop controls, and strong auditability.
- Use the tag checklists below to validate product-specific requirements for your stack.

### Tag Checklists

#### AI

- Separate AI-assisted suggestions from deterministic rules and document both paths.
- Ask what data is used to produce outputs and whether your data is used for training.
- Validate output quality on your own historical datasets with agreed success metrics.
- Review bias, explainability, and compliance controls appropriate for hiring decisions.
- Confirm admin controls for prompts, templates, and model behavior updates.

#### Marketplace

- Understand supply-side vetting, quality signals, and dispute resolution.
- Verify pricing model, fees, and what guarantees (if any) exist.
- Check matching transparency and how rankings can be influenced or corrected.
- Ensure integration with your hiring workflow for handoffs and tracking.

#### Matching

- Confirm which attributes drive matching and whether they are configurable.
- Evaluate false positives/negatives on historical roles and applicants.
- Check explainability and controls to prevent over-reliance on a single score.
- Review fairness impact and monitoring across segments.
